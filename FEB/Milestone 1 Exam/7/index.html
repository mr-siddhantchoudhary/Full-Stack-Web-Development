<!-- 7. Remove Duplicates

In an online shopping application, customers can add multiple items to their cart. However, sometimes 
customers accidentally add the same item more than once, resulting in duplicate items in their cart. The 
duplicate items not only make it difficult for the customer to track the items they want to purchase but also 
affect the accuracy of the purchase order

To solve this problem, the application needs to remove duplicated items from the customer's cart. The program 
should take the customer's cart with duplicates as input, and return a new cart without duplicates.


Write a program to solve the problde of duplicate items in the cart by removing duplicates. 


example: 

        customer's cart = [soap, Soap, kettle, horn, bike, bike, sidhu, sidhu, hell]

        returning cart = [soap, kettle, horn, bike, sidhu, hell]
